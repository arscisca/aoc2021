These are my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

This is my first time joining the Advent of Code, and as a self-imposed rule I've decided I'll only use **Rust** for all my solutions.
It is also my first time using Rust and I'm very excited about it, so it's an excuse to learn it and track my progress!
